Assignment #4

This assignment went okay.  Easier that the first one or two.  More
difficult than the third though.

At this point.  I have yet to get the very last bit to work.  The
callByName flag I haven't quite figured out.  Everything works, 
but the first-class functions examples 1-4 breaks after I hook
up the call by name substitution function.

So, after much head banging, I was able to get everything to work.
My logic of the actual substitution function was correct however
I assumed that the problem was in my logic on the recursive call
of the Apply function, when really the problem was in my understanding
of bound vs unbound variables within a case within a match.
I was substituting the expression y within my recursive function for
every variable that I came across, not just the ones which matched the 
x string.

Aside from that hickup, it went well.  I wish I had timed it out a little
better.  Started on all the cases from prior exercises for part 1 last
week, that was easy.  Got to the harder part, and didn't get back to
it until a couple days ago.  Powered through parts 1-3 until hickup.

Overall fun, but I got a little lost at the end.
